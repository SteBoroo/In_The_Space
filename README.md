This is just a simple project made in python with like 2 weeks of programming skills.
I'm trying to improve the code to make it run better and to make it cleaner.
Also i'm new to github and don't really know how it works lol.

Basically the program creates a ball (a ship ideally) that moves around with acceleration and deceleration, trying to collect points and avoid asteroids.
move with WASD, L to dash (u r immortal during the dash but cannot collect items). The pink circle creates a shield that makes you immortal for a short period (also allows you to collect items while dashing) and the red ball is a bomb collectible that, when in hand and you press K, generates an explosion that destroys asteroids and then disappears.
The number of asteroids increases as you progress with the score and sometimes many of them appear simultaneously.

As stated before, i don't have much programming skills so don't be surprised if there are useless things, loops or variables. Also that's why i joined the community, to find help and ways to improve.
Feel free to play, that's obvious.
One last thing: variable names are a mix of italian and english. Because i'm italian and when i started i didn't really plan to update the code here.
Thanks
